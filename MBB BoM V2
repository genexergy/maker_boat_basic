PROPULSION
2x Blue Robotics M200 motors w/ their ESCs, propellers and (optionally) propeller caps (https://bluerobotics.com/store/thrusters/t100-t200-thrusters/m200-motor/)
NOTE: There are 2 different versions of the M200 motor. The standard M200 motor and a BlueBoat variant of the M200 motor with installed bulkhead penetrator and cable connector. If you get the latter, be aware that the motor mounts will need to be modified as the cable attaches to the motor at the base and not at the side.
NOTE 2: Be sure that when you purchase the propellors for the M200 motors that you get one that turns clockwise and one that turns counterclockwise.
